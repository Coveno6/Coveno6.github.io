            <h1>Coaching Football</h1>
            <p>Football has been a great passion of mine for 10+ years now and this past year has given me the opprountity to get back in the game as a coach. I am the offensive
                coordinator for Groton-Dunstable (where I attended school) in Massachusetts. Coaching challenges me in many ways and pushes me to grow as a critical thinker, communicator
                and leader. The days can be long but I have a ton of fun with the other coaches and players and am so thankful I've been able to continue my football career as a coach. 
            </p>
  
            <p>As the offensive coordinator I install plays, contribute to depth charts and call the offensive plays during the game. By nature of High School Football plays don't always
                (more like often don't) go to plan and its on me ro figure out what went wrong and what we need to change or improve to make it better. Football had a massive impact on me 
                as a human being as it requires immense amount of dedication, teamwork and work ethic. I believe football can be a incredibly powerful force in peoples lives and hope that I
                am showing my players this and inspiring in ways similar to the way my coaches inspired me.
