          <h1>Where's the News?</h1>
          <p>Where's the news is an android application that eneabled users to search for free news articles based on location. Users could either use their current location
              or search for a specific location they had in mind. The application made use of a couple of free sources such as FireBase DB to store user information and google's 
              free geolocator for location searching. This was a stand alone solo project and my first introduction to mobile app developmet. I would love to do more app development
              in the future. Unfortunatly I am an apple user so I would like to try IOS development next time.
