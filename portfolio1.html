          <h1>Curriculum Utility</h1>
          <p>Curriculum Utility is my senior thesis project and recevied the 2021 Arnold Meltzer Senior Design Award for best project. I
              had 2 wonderful partners, Alex Broaddus and Kevin Deems (links below) and we built this from the ground up. Our professors were so happy with
              our work they were hoping more students would continue the project the following year to get it into a more release ready state. 
          </p>

          <p>So what is this? Curriculum Utility is essentially an augmented schedule maker for college students. We built it with GWU (our university) in mind
              but this could easily be used by any college student that follows the general GWU template which is not particularly unique. This tool has 3 features.
              One, a traditional schedule maker which accounts for variables like time of day, total credits, and ensures the student doesn't book a class they've 
              already completed. The second tool is a curriculum tracker, which keeps track of the classes the student has completed and tracks what classes the student
              still needs to complete to graduate. The final tool is a semester planner which tracks similar data to the curriculum tracker but also accounts for prerequesistes 
              and helps students plan over the long term for their path to graduation.
