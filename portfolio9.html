          <h1>Baking!</h1>
          <p>Another major hobby of mine is baking! Most of my creations are straight from Dominique Ansel's Master Class Course.
            I love being able to create something delicious and beautiful that can be shared and enjoyed by lots of people. I have 
            always had a soft spot for pastries and now making them myself makes them even more delicious! One of my major failed 
            attempts is the Croisant which is especially dissapoiting because it's a week long process! Hopefully one day I'll get it 
            right but until then I'll have to settle for my other creations.

            From top to bottom shown here is my strawberry tart, chocolate mousse cake, mini madeleines and apple tart!
