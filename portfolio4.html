          <h1>STARS</h1>
          <p>STARS is Raytheon Technologies' air traffic control program and has been the main focus for my job for the past 3 years. At this point in time
              the focus of STARS engineers is to update features and fix bugs within the product. STARS is a massive code base and deals with complex inputs
              and distributive nodes. As a software engineer on this project, my job is to implement updates and fixes to the system suggested by both the air 
              traffic controllers and Raytheon's intensive testing process. We work in an AGILE work environment so there is plenty of team work and cooperation as we work on this 
              complex system.
