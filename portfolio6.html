          <h1>Teachers Assistant - Operating Systems & Intoduction to Software Development</h1>
          <p>TAing is a critical component of the educational process at GWU. My senior year I TAed 2 classes. Operating Sytems was my first experience TAing and is one of the most
              challenging courses required for computer science student as GW. This class looks at the lowest level of code and introduces complex topics such as mutexes and memory
              management. As a TA it was my job to help students understand the topics and the assignmnets via office hours. I was available for at least 4 hours a week for students
              to reach out with questions. TA's are always older students who have already completed the course because it offers the current students a different vantage point and 
              a potentionally more comfortable environment for the student. This was in the middle of the pandamic so unfortunatly everything was virtual which posed extra stress 
              upon the students. 
          </p>

          <p>I also TAed an Intorduction to Computer Science class, which was a much easier expereince from a techinical standpoint as it only delt with intoructory topics. The class
              still posed challenges as the students has a more varied educational background so communicating and teaching them, especially because we were still virtual, was arguably
              more challenging than it was in the Operating Systems class. 
          </p>
          <p>
            TAing these courses was a great refresher for me to relearn the basics of computer science and solidify the foundation of my education before graduating.
