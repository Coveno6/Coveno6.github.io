          <h1>MARS</h1>
          <p>MARS is Raytheon Technologies' Research and Development porject which I have been involved with from near its inception. The goal of MARS is to 
              consolidate applications used by air traffic controllers to minimize the number of screens and interfaces required to do their job. My task on this 
              project is to build a monotoring system from the ground up. This system filters through a massive database hosted by <a href="https://prometheus.io/" target="_blank">Prometheus</a> to determine 
              the health of the hardware in the system. This was a fullstack assignment as it required backend interactions with the Prometheus database and frontend
              interactions with the user. The MARS system is designed with touch screen in mind but can operate on standard monitors as well. This is a much smaller project
              than STARS and so the team environment is also smaller. We have a core team of 5 people working on this mostly on isolated tasks within the project.
